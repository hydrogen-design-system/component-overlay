// Hydrogen / Components / Module

// Development Notes:
// - please ensure all functions are defined with "004" at the end of their name.
// - please ensure all references to the parent component's selector also include "004" (e.g. [data-h2-accordion004])
// This is so that when the component is built, it produces a version-locked set of code that can me manually imported to override newer versions.
