// Hydrogen / Component / System
// This file is processed and then imported into @hydrogen-design-system/system

// File paths must respect how the system's architecture works.
// - root
//   - core
//     - styles
//   - properties
//     - styles
//     - individual properties
//       - styles
//   - components
//     - individual components
//       - [you're here]

// Unlike the versioned copy, this stylesheet doesn't require Hydrogen's core because the core is imported by the system itself in that repository later on.

// Forward theme variables from the core module first so that they can be accessed and modified.
@forward "../../core/defaults";

// Load map variables from the core module so that the component can leverage them when generating selectors.
@use "../../core/maps" as maps;

// Load theme variables from the core module so that they can be passed to the component mixins.
@use "../../core/defaults" as var;

// Load the component so that its mixins can be accessed.
@use "component-$COMP" as *;

// Load the generic mixin with its respective theme variables.
[data-h2-$COMP] {
    @include h2-component-$COMP-generic();
}

// Load custom mixins here. Please refer to existing components for examples, as well as how to pass variables, maps, and functions.
