# Hydrogen: overlay

Hydrogen's components are built using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), and [CSSnano](https://cssnano.co/).

Hydrogen components require [Cash](https://kenwheeler.github.io/cash/) to work properly. Cash is a lightweight jQuery alternative and will eventually be phased out of Hydrogen in favour of vanilla JavaScript.

This component module contains the following in the `dist` folder:
- the component's code that is imported by @hydrogen-design-system/system
- a versioned, isolated copy of the component that can be used independently of the system, either imported by a Sass project, or pulled as compiled CSS

This component currently supports the following markup and/or frameworks:
- raw HTML

* Please ensure that work on this component updates all supported markup where possible.
